# Part 4

**Note:** For each part, I do not know beforehand how many different apps/projects I will have to make, and since there was no explicit warning telling me that I may have to deploy the code using this repository, I have decided to keep each distinct npm app in its own directory.


## Exercise 4.1

Copied the code as given in the exercise, structured it, installed the necessary packages, dev dependencies, etc. and got it working. Tested the one POST and one GET endpoint with Postman. It is connected to the same Atlas cluster as userd in the last part but to a different database.

**NOTE:** When the exercise said "Turn the application into a functioning npm project", I assumed that I would have to structure it along the lines of what was shown in the course. Only later did I realize that structuring it was part of the second exercise. So I have inadvertanly completed 4.1 already.
